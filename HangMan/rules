✅ GAME RULES:
The game chooses a secret word (you can hardcode or pick randomly from a list/file).
Player must guess letters one by one.
If the guessed letter is in the word → reveal it in the correct positions.
If the guess is wrong, player loses a “life” (usually 6–8 tries).

Game ends when:
Player guesses the whole word → YOU WIN! 🎉
Player runs out of lives → GAME OVER 💀

The game should show:

The masked word (e.g., _ _ a _ _)
Letters guessed so far
Remaining attempts
